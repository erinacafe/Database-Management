Correct output for all queries
Correct SQL statements
SQL statements are readable

Recommendations: 
 To improve your readability, write queries instead of this
  SELECT *
  FROM products
  WHERE city != 'Dallas' AND city != 'Duluth' AND priceUSD >= 1;
 do it like this:
  SELECT *
  FROM products
  WHERE city != 'Dallas' 
    AND city != 'Duluth' 
    AND priceUSD >= 1;
