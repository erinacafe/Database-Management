Correct queries
Correct SQL statements
SQL statements are readable
Correct output for some queries

Recommendations: 
 To improve your readability, write queries instead of this
  SELECT DISTINCT pid
  FROM orders
  WHERE aid IN (	SELECT aid
  		FROM orders
  		WHERE cid IN (	SELECT cid
  				FROM customers
  				WHERE city = 'Dallas' ))
  ORDER BY pid DESC;

 do it like this:
  SELECT DISTINCT pid
  FROM orders
  WHERE aid IN (SELECT aid
                FROM orders
                WHERE cid IN (SELECT cid
                              FROM customers
                              WHERE city = 'Dallas'))
  ORDER BY pid DESC;       -- notice the indentation of subqueries



7. Get all customers who have the same discount as that of any customers in
Dallas or London

Incorrect output
- It seems like you over did it with the NOT IN part and gives incorrect
  output.



8. Tell me about check constraints: What are they? What are they good for? What
is the advantage of putting that sort of thing inside the database? Make up
some examples of good uses of check constraints and some examples of bad uses
of check constraints. Explain the differences in your examples and argue your
case.

- You did not include -actual- check constraints examples, just descriptions of
  them. 


In general: 

- Test all your SQL statements.

- Make sure you read all the instructions for queries really well.
